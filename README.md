Kana Helper was inspired when I started learning Japanese. 
While memorizing the Japanese characters for Hiragana and Katakana I wanted something that would test my knowledge randomly, so I knew that I held on to the knowledge.
The app, Kana Helper, has a graph of Hiragana and Katakana. The user is able to select which characters they would like to practice and test their knowledge.
If practicing it will be titled for example ki (Hiragana) with a low opacity background of the selected character. 
They will be able to trace over it to learn how to write it and better help commit it to memory. 
If testing their knowledge they will have a blank canvas with only the titled character of which they are testing. The user will write out the character and see if they know it.
If they are struggling with remembering what the character looked like or want to see if they were right after writing it down. 
They will be able to toggle the background and the character will appear just as if they were practicing it in order to see if they were correct or refresh their memory.

The source code in FingerPath.java and KanaTrace.java were used from Sylvan Saurel's github in order to get the paint tool function working properly in the Android App.
Below is the credit and github repository of where I found the source code that helped me get the program running properly.
